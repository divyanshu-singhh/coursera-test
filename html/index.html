                <p> When the web was frst taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages. These days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you. To try this out for yourself, simply go to the sample code for this chapter, at www.htmlandcssbook.com/ code/ and click on the link called "View Source." Once you have opened this page, you can look for the View menu in your browser, and select the option that says Source or View source. (The title changes depending on what browser you are using.) You should see a new window appear, and it will contain the source code that was used to create this page. You can see this result in the photograph on the right. The page you see is the window at the top; the code is below. At frst this code might look complicated but don't be discouraged. By the time you have fnished the next chapter of this book, you will be able to understand it. All of the examples for this book are on the website, and you can use this simple technique on any of the example pages to see how they work. You can also download all of the code for this book from the same website by clicking on the "Download" link.When the web was frst taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.
